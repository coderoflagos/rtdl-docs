# Changelog

## V0.0.1 - 20220126

### What works?
rtdl is not full-featured yet, but it is currently functional. You can configure streams that 
ingest json from an rtdl endpoint, process them into Parquet, and save the files to a destination 
configured in your stream. rtdl can write files locally, to AWS S3, and to GCP Cloud Storage.

### What doesn't work/what's next on the roadmap?
  * Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a contributor license agreement
  * Cataloging data in Hive Metastore
    * This will let you use your data with a much broader range of data tools.
  * Adding Presto to the stack
    * This will make connecting into a whole ecosystem of analytics, BI, and data science tools 
    much easier
  * Adding support for Azure Blob Storage
  * Add support for more compressions - currently default Snappy compression is supported
