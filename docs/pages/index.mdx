rtdl makes it easy to build and maintain a real-time data lake. You configure a data stream 
with a source (from a tool like Segment) and a cloud storage destination, and rtdl builds you 
a real-time data lake in Parquet format cataloged in Apache Hive Metastore – so you can access 
your real-time data with common BI and ML tools. You provide the streams, rtdl builds your lake.
